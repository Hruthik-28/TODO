- This is a simple todo web application built using React.js. 
- It is designed to help individuals keep track of their tasks and manage their to-do lists efficiently. 
- This documentation provides an overview of the code structure, components, and how to use the application.

## Code Structure

### `App.jsx`

`App.jsx` is the main application component and serves as the entry point of the application. It contains the following functions:

- `addTodo(todo)`: Adds a new todo item to the list.
- `updateTodo(id, todo)`: Updates an existing todo item with the provided data.
- `deleteTodo(id)`: Deletes a todo item by its unique ID.
- `toggleComplete(id)`: Toggles the completion status of a todo item.
- `useEffect`: Contains two `useEffect` hooks for handling data persistence in local storage.

### `TodoContext.js`

`TodoContext.js` defines the `TodoContext` and `TodoProvider` components, which manage the application's state. It also provides a custom hook `useTodo` for accessing the context within components.

### `TodoForm.jsx`

`TodoForm.jsx` is a functional component representing the form for adding new todo items. It contains:

- `useState` for managing the input field's value.
- `useTodo` hook to access the context and call `addTodo` to add new items.

### `TodoItem.jsx`

`TodoItem.jsx` is a functional component representing an individual todo item. It includes:

- State variables for managing todo item content and edit mode.
- `useTodo` hook for accessing context and performing actions such as updating, toggling, and deleting todo items.
